# DDOS_CYber_Threat_Detection

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are flooding threats that deny a legitimate user from
accessing its intended service. It is one of the most prevalent threats that the Cybersecurity
industry is facing as per the recent market research. Therefore it is of foremost importance
to understand and detect different types of DDoS threats.
Denial of Service (DoS) and distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is now a common
means of attack that affects seriously network security and the quality of online services. This
analysis report analyzes the DoS (DDoS) attack prevention principles and gives an thorough
analysis of existing prevention techniques, proposed to prevent DoS (DDoS) attacks in three
ways: using a router DoS attack prevention, increase the trusted platform module, increase
system defenses. Reflection and amplification are mechanisms commonly used in DDoS
attacks. These simple and very effective techniques gained popularity around 2013. They
take advantage of publicly accessible UDP services to overload victims with response traffic.
Attackers usually do not have to abuse old versions of protocols or exploit vulnerabilities
instead, legitimate traffic is used.
The IT industry has recently seen a steady increase of distributed denial of service
(DDoS) attacks. Years ago, DDoS attacks were perceived as minor nuisances perpetrated
by novice attackers who did it for fun and it was relatively easy to mitigate them.
Unfortunately, that situation is no more. DDoS attacks are now a sophisticated activity,
and in many cases, big business.
Info Security Magazine reported 2.9 million DDoS attacks in Q1 of 2021, an increase of 31
% over the same period in 2020. DDoS attacks rose 31 % in Q1 2021 over the same period
in 2020, to 2.9 million attacks. In recent years, we have seen an exponential increase in
DDoS attacks that have incapacitated businesses for significant amounts of time.
